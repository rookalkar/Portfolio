            <p>Hi! I'm Ruchi. I used to work as a front end developer and then I switched gears. I am now studying Human Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan in the lovely town of Ann Arbor. I am keenly interested in data visualisation, UX and front end development. You could also hit me up if you want to know about the best chai in town :) </p>

                  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                  <p>This project focusses on providing a solution to encourage women in technology by enabling pair programming. This coding practice improves technical proficieny and develops a network of colleagues and mentors. </br>
                    The problem domain of pair programming can be divided into three sub-problems:
                  </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Partner: Who to pair program with? How to find this person? What qualities to look for? </li>
                      <li> Location: Where to pair program - physical location or remote? </li>
                      <li> Project: What task to work on? </li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>
                  The Coder Girls project focuses on the problem of searching for a partner.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Process </h4>
                  <img src="img/portfolio/582/582.png" class="process" alt="process">
                  <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                  <p>I looked at the three most popular coding-partner search alternatives currently existing and compared their feautres, pros and cons</p>
                  <!-- TODO: Table -->
                  <h4>User Research Interviews</h4>
                  <p>I also conducted 5 user interviews of graduate and undergraduate girl student in computer science who have pair programmed in the past. While all of them enjoyed the process when done in class, most of them had never tried it outside of class because it was difficult to find someone to pair with who had shared interests and proficiency.</p>

                  <h4>Participatory Design</h4>
                  <p>I explored multiple design approaches, such as reflective, participatory, value sensitive design. For a topic that involved gender inclusion and coding, I thought it was best to go via the participatory design process. The target user has a lot of tacit knowledge and pain points that aid the design.</p>

                  <h4>Sketching</h4>
                  <p>I started out by brainstorming a few possible solutions to the idea and expanded them to include workflows for each. This helped me explore a range of solutions, from physical to mixed reality:
                    Using a band that lights up when users cross paths, using a dedicated app, fast-switching hackathons, adding badges on LinkedIn profiles, using existing social media networks and posting on MOOCS discussion boards were some of them.
                  </p>
                  <!-- TODO: Insert both sketch images -->

                  <h4>Persona</h4>
                  <p>I created an empathy map for each persona involving their Needs, Goals and Motivations, Tasks, Feelings, Pain Points and Influences. This helped me organise their information into Behaviour, Needs, Goals/ Motivation and Personality. Adding their demographics and a personal quote (from the interviews I had conducted earlier) helped bring them to life.</p>

                  <p>Since the existing application had been in use for over a year, we decided to take up the <em>Participatory Design</em> approach as our users had tacit knowledge about the tool. User interviews were conducted to find the pain points in the existing system. This was followed by drawing an information diagram of the current system and reorganising it using new categories to arrive at the new information diagram via the process of whiteboarding. Wireframes were created using the results of the earlier activity. A new look was decided for the web-app, keeping in mind the Flipkart brand’s new theme and adding material-UI. High Fidelity prototype was built in code (ReactJS). The new system was tested by users by conducting contextual inquiry style interviews, where users interacted with the system and provided first-usage feedback. After some tweaks, a sample set of users was onboarded for a week. The feedback received from this set was then incorporated into the system, resulting in the final development and deployment.

                  <p>Data within the company has to be secured with respect to who is using it and for what purpose. The team brainstormed multiple solution to adding guardrails, keeping in mind the various types of data the company owned. Brainstorming resulted in creating a few key ideas that we thought were possible technically. These were presented to the stakeholders and after debate and a SWOT analysis, the idea of creating ‘groups’ within company with admins who could decide privileges for their users was selected. After multiple more rounds of problem scoping and wireframing, a high fidelity prototype was built in ReactJS (HTML, CSS, JS). USability testing was conducted on this tool with each user being given specific tasks and being observed. Finally, the finished product code was deployed.</p>

                  <p>The Government of Maharashtra conducts surveys every years to record the presence of infrastructural facilities in schools all across the state. It also records values of gender ratio, student to teacher ratio and a separate examination to survey the learning levels at these schools. These surveys are extensive in terms of geography covered.
                  </p>
                  <p>The state of Maharashtra can be divided into divisions -> districts -> clusters -> villages -> schools.</p>
                  <p>The project started out with exploring the data set and it was soon clear that this information can be overwhelming. So we decided to make it easier to extract sense-worthy information from this dataset. Various visualisations were tested and we zeroed in on a TreeMap as it was perfect for showing hierarchical data. The project was aimed at conveying the presence and magnitude of problem of areas at each level in the state.</p>
                  <p>Hierarchical data can be represented as a treemap. This visualisation takes the treemap one step further, by adding a choropleth element to it. Not only are the rectangles’ areas proportional to the enrolment of that geographical area, their colors represent the percentage of schools that have a particular educational infrastructural facility such as playground/ electricity/ water/ ramps etc. This allows for identification and deeper analysis of problem areas by analysing sub-areas. It also allows comparison between geographical areas and between facilities. Smooth transitions upon zoom maintain visual continuity and highlight of areas, display of specific data on hover allowed for context maintenance. The tool can be extended to include other facilities and states.</p>

                  <p>We began by exploring the concept of GenderFuck and what it meant in the society we were living in. This lead to a lot of research about gender discrimination in the modern context and also about gender fluidity. Using Papert’s ideas, we wanted to build an object which the user could think with. So we decided to build a board game which would allow the players to feel what real people feel when they are discriminated against.</p>
                  <p>The examples of gender discrimination were crowdsourced from our social media network. While it limited the society, we received a great variation within that spectrum.</p>
                  <p>These examples were then given ‘influence points’ based on how significantly they affected the person's life.</p>
                  <p>Using the influence points and examples, a twist on the traditional snakes and ladders was created. The game consisted of cards, which spelled out the players gender and punishment for belonging to that gender. The punishment was determined by the points calculated earlier.</p>

                  <p>The game was tested with fellow graduate students to get a sense of what was going right and wrong. We observed that 4 players were the most optimum to enjoying this game. The final prototype was built and displayed in an exhibition where undergraduate students could play with it. The game invoked multiple reactions, often leading to heated arguments and discussions about the discriminations. It was particularly interesting to note the knowledge exchange happening during the game play between members, such as “My mom does this. Why is this wrong?”, followed by an explanation.
