        <p>Hi, I'm Ruchi. </br> </br> Currently pursuing a master's degree at the University of Michigan in HCI, I am a UX Designer, Front End Developer and a Data Visualisation Enthusiast. I love everything to do with charts, graphs and experiences that make me smile. I'm working on a research project about individual biases when reading data charts. <br/> <br/> I’ve travelled to 15 countries so far and I love the multi-cultural experience that has offered. In my free time, you’ll find me reading / watching political dramas (current obsession is West Wing) or satisfying my sweet tooth. Hit me up if you want to talk about any of my projects or want to know the best chocolate fudge in Ann Arbor / Bangalore / Mumbai / Goa / Nagpur! <br/> <br/> Seeking internship roles for Summer of 2018  </p>

                  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                  <p>The number of women technology is alarmingly low. A lot of women leave the field due to lack of mentorship and network to tap onto. There are also unsure about their proficiency. The concept of pair-programming is the perfect solution for this problem as it not only helps improve skills and boost confidence, it also builds a network of women in technology. However, women often face difficulties in finding partners pair program with. To tackle this problem, I have created a Web Application called Coder Girls which allows users to search for pair programming partners.
                  </p>
                  </br>

                  <h4>Process </h4>
                  <img src="img/portfolio/582/582.png" class="process" alt="process">
                  </br>

                  <h4>User Research Interviews</h4>
                  <p>I also conducted 5 user interviews of graduate and undergraduate girl students in computer science who have pair programmed in the past. While all of them enjoyed the process when done in class, most of them had never tried it outside of class because it was difficult to find someone to pair with who had shared interests and proficiency.</p>
                  </br>

                  <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                  <p>I looked at the three most popular coding-partner search alternatives currently existing and compared their feautres, pros and cons</p>
                  <img src="img/portfolio/582/comp.png" alt="analysis">
                  </br>

                  <h4>Participatory Design</h4>
                  <p>I explored multiple design approaches, such as reflective, participatory, value sensitive design. For a topic that involved gender inclusion and coding, I thought it was best to go via the participatory design process. The target user has a lot of tacit knowledge and pain points that aid the design.</p>
                  </br>

                  <h4>Sketching</h4>
                  <p>I started out by brainstorming a few possible solutions to the idea and expanded them to include workflows for each. This helped me explore a range of solutions, from physical to mixed reality:
                    Using a band that lights up when users cross paths, using a dedicated app, fast-switching hackathons, adding badges on LinkedIn profiles, using existing social media networks and posting on MOOCS discussion boards were some of them.
                  </p>

                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <h4>Persona</h4>
                  <p>I created an empathy map for each persona involving their Needs, Goals and Motivations, Tasks, Feelings, Pain Points and Influences. This helped me organise their information into Behaviour, Needs, Goals/ Motivation and Personality. Adding their demographics and a personal quote (from the interviews I had conducted earlier) helped bring them to life.</p>

                  <h4> QOC Design synthesis and Design defence </h4>
                  <p> I identified one critical feature in the application and explored three solution of this feature. The most critical feature for this project is Search - how a user searchs, what is returned in the search, how is the search list presented, what is the order of the list and other such questions. I came up with possible ways to achieve these tasks and analyses each approach against a set of criteria particular to that question. This helped me determine major design choice such as forced login to allow customisation, profile creation to deliver rich results in searches by other users, ordering searches by matching interests to increase chances of match and using in-app messaging for contact between two users for ease of use and quick respone time. The detailed questions, options and criteria used for each question are shown in the diagrams below. </p>
                  <div>

                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <h4> Paper Prototyping</h4>
                  <p>Paper prototyping was a quick, easy and cheap method to get feedback on my design. I tested the prototype with real users and dicovered that I hadn't included the feature to edit profile. I also learnt that adding linkedIn search was much appreciated by most users as it reduced their onboarding time. I gained a lot of contructive feedback in this process and re-iterated over my design to incorporate the insights gained from it.</p>

                  <p>Since the existing application had been in use for over a year, we decided to take up the <em>Participatory Design</em> approach as our users had tacit knowledge about the tool. User interviews were conducted to find the pain points in the existing system. This was followed by drawing an information diagram of the current system and reorganising it using new categories to arrive at the new information diagram via the process of whiteboarding. Wireframes were created using the results of the earlier activity. A new look was decided for the web-app, keeping in mind the Flipkart brand’s new theme and adding material-UI. High Fidelity prototype was built in code (ReactJS). The new system was tested by users by conducting contextual inquiry style interviews, where users interacted with the system and provided first-usage feedback. After some tweaks, a sample set of users was onboarded for a week. The feedback received from this set was then incorporated into the system, resulting in the final development and deployment.

                  <p>Data within the company has to be secured with respect to who is using it and for what purpose. The team brainstormed multiple solution to adding guardrails, keeping in mind the various types of data the company owned. Brainstorming resulted in creating a few key ideas that we thought were possible technically. These were presented to the stakeholders and after debate and a SWOT analysis, the idea of creating ‘groups’ within company with admins who could decide privileges for their users was selected. After multiple more rounds of problem scoping and wireframing, a high fidelity prototype was built in ReactJS (HTML, CSS, JS). USability testing was conducted on this tool with each user being given specific tasks and being observed. Finally, the finished product code was deployed.</p>

                  <p>The Government of Maharashtra conducts surveys every years to record the presence of infrastructural facilities in schools all across the state. It also records values of gender ratio, student to teacher ratio and a separate examination to survey the learning levels at these schools. These surveys are extensive in terms of geography covered.
                  </p>
                  <p>The state of Maharashtra can be divided into divisions -> districts -> clusters -> villages -> schools.</p>
                  <p>The project started out with exploring the data set and it was soon clear that this information can be overwhelming. So we decided to make it easier to extract sense-worthy information from this dataset. Various visualisations were tested and we zeroed in on a TreeMap as it was perfect for showing hierarchical data. The project was aimed at conveying the presence and magnitude of problem of areas at each level in the state.</p>
                  <p>Hierarchical data can be represented as a treemap. This visualisation takes the treemap one step further, by adding a choropleth element to it. Not only are the rectangles’ areas proportional to the enrolment of that geographical area, their colors represent the percentage of schools that have a particular educational infrastructural facility such as playground/ electricity/ water/ ramps etc. This allows for identification and deeper analysis of problem areas by analysing sub-areas. It also allows comparison between geographical areas and between facilities. Smooth transitions upon zoom maintain visual continuity and highlight of areas, display of specific data on hover allowed for context maintenance. The tool can be extended to include other facilities and states.</p>

                  <p>We began by exploring the concept of GenderFuck and what it meant in the society we were living in. This lead to a lot of research about gender discrimination in the modern context and also about gender fluidity. Using Papert’s ideas, we wanted to build an object which the user could think with. So we decided to build a board game which would allow the players to feel what real people feel when they are discriminated against.</p>
                  <p>The examples of gender discrimination were crowdsourced from our social media network. While it limited the society, we received a great variation within that spectrum.</p>
                  <p>These examples were then given ‘influence points’ based on how significantly they affected the person's life.</p>
                  <p>Using the influence points and examples, a twist on the traditional snakes and ladders was created. The game consisted of cards, which spelled out the players gender and punishment for belonging to that gender. The punishment was determined by the points calculated earlier.</p>

                  <p>The game was tested with fellow graduate students to get a sense of what was going right and wrong. We observed that 4 players were the most optimum to enjoying this game. The final prototype was built and displayed in an exhibition where undergraduate students could play with it. The game invoked multiple reactions, often leading to heated arguments and discussions about the discriminations. It was particularly interesting to note the knowledge exchange happening during the game play between members, such as “My mom does this. Why is this wrong?”, followed by an explanation.

                  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                  <p>ICPSCR (International Consortium for Political and Social Research) is the world leader in data curation of social data. The process within the organisation varies from data acquisition, data cleaning, data massaging, generating metadata and creating codebooks to final release of data for public use on their website. The organisation went through a structural change in January 2018. There exists several topics under ICPSR such as aging, criminal justice, drug use etc. Prior to January 2018, the organisation was divided into topical archives , i.e teams with expertise in a particular archive. Each archive had its own manager who ccordinated with funders (who set requirements for the curation). Post the reorganisation, all the data curators were brought into one team, lead by curation supervisors. The supervisors communicated with the managers. This change from topical expertise to a general pool has lead to pushback in terms of accepting a uniform standard, since they are dealing wit historical ways of doing things.

                  <h4>Interview Methodology</h4>
                  <p> We conducted a total of 6 interviews from across the various level of the organisational heirarchy (project managers, data curators, curation supervisors and head of the organisation). The interviews were conducted in the contextual style, where the interviewer asked the questions at the place of work of the interviewee, often asking the interviewee to demonstrate tasks which came up during the interview. This process helped us discover problems and social issues within the organisation. The interview were conducted by two members - one acting as the interviewer and one as the note taker. We also collected audio recordings of the interview and images from the workplace to guide our analysis.</p>

                  <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                  <p> Each interview was followed by an interpretation session with 24 hours of the interview. During these sessions, we went over the interview notes, recordings and images and analyses these to generate affinity notes - one complete sentence that would escirbe what was happening at point. We also noted down what any further questions we wanted to cover in future interviews and jotted down our analysis of the events.</p>

                  <h4> Affinity Wall</h4>
                  <p> After the 6 interviews, we had about 500 notes. We went ahead and categorised these in three levels. The white notes were grouped together by similarity of content or possible causal relationships to arrive at teh blue notes. We then repeated the process two more times to arrive at green and pink notes. We ensured that none of clusters had more than 7 ideas in each. This helped us in writing clear detailed sentences describing each cluster. The final pink notes gave us an idea of what exactly was happening in the organisation and the key issues faced by the staff. </p>

                  <p> We are currently in the process of using our analysis to come up with recommendations. Please check back soon for the final report. </p>
